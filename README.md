*"If you laugh at a joke, what difference does it make if subsequently you are told that the joke was created by an algorithm?" - Marcus du Sautoy, The Creative Code*

`aRtsy` aims to make generative art accessible to the general public in a straightforward and standardized manner. The package provides algorithms for creating artworks that incorporate some form of randomness and are dependent on the set `seed`. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate function with its own set of parameters that can be tweaked.

Good luck hunting for some good `seed`'s!

## Artwork of the day

Every 24 hours this repository randomly generates and tweets an artwork from the `aRtsy` library. The full collection of daily artworks is available on the [twitter](https://twitter.com/aRtsy_package) feed and the [mastodon](https://botsin.space/web/@aRtsy_package) feed. This is today's artwork:

</p>

## Installation

The most recently released version of `aRtsy` can be downloaded from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=aRtsy) by running the following command in R:

```r
install.packages("aRtsy")
```

Alternatively, you can download the development version from GitHub using:

```r
devtools::install_github("koenderks/aRtsy")
```

After installation, the `aRtsy` package can be loaded with:

```r
library(aRtsy)
```

**Note:** Render times in RStudio can be quite long for some artworks. It is therefore recommended that you save the artwork to a file (e.g., `.png` or `.jpg`) before viewing it. You can save the artwork in an appropriate size and quality using the `saveCanvas()` function.

```r
artwork <- canvas_strokes(colors = c("black", "white"))
saveCanvas(artwork, filename = "myArtwork.png")
```

### The Iterative collection

The Iterative collection implements algorithms whose state depend on the previous state. These algorithms mostly use a grid based canvas to draw on. On this grid, each point represents a pixel of the final image. By assigning a color to these points according to certain rules, one can create the images in this collection.

#### Langton's ant

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langtons_ant), Langton's ant is a turmite with a very specific set of rules. In particular, after choosing a starting position the algorithm involves repeating the following three rules:

1. On a non-colored block: turn 90 degrees clockwise, un-color the block, move forward one block,
1. On a colored block: turn 90 degrees counter-clockwise, color the block, move forward one block,
1. If a certain number of iterations has passed, choose a different color which corresponds to a different combination of these rules.

set.seed(1)
canvas_ant(colors = colorPalette("house"))
# see ?canvas_ant for more input parameters of this function
```

#### Chladni figures

This function draws [Chladni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Chladni) figures on the canvas. It works by generating one or multiple sine waves on a square matrix. You can provide the waves to be added yourself. After generating the waves it is possible to warp them using a [domain warping](https://iquilezles.org/articles/warp/) technique. The angles and distances for the warp can be set manually or according to a type of noise.

set.seed(1)
canvas_chladni(colors = colorPalette("tuscany1"))
# see ?canvas_chladni for more input parameters of this function
```

#### Cobwebs

This function draws a lines in a structure that resemble cobwebs. The algorithm creates many [Fibonacci spirals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_spiral) shifted by random noise from a normal distribution.

```r
set.seed(1)
canvas_cobweb(colors = colorPalette("tuscany1"))
# see ?canvas_cobweb for more input parameters of this function
```

#### Collatz conjecture

The Collatz conjecture is also known as the `3x+1` equation. The algorithm draws lines according to a simple rule set:

1. Take a random positive number.
2. If the number is even, divide it by 2.
3. If the number is odd, multiply the number by 3 and add 1.
4. Repeat to get a sequence of numbers.

By visualizing the sequence for each number, overlaying sequences that are the same, and bending the edges differently for even and odd numbers in the sequence, organic looking structures can occur.

```r
set.seed(1)
canvas_collatz(colors = colorPalette("tuscany3"))
# see ?canvas_collatz for more input parameters of this function
```

#### Fractal flames

This function implements the Fractal Flame algorithm described in [this article](https://flam3.com/flame_draves.pdf) by Scott Draves and Erik Reckase. It iterates a set of randomly determined function systems following one or multiple specific variations to determine a set of points. You can specify which variations from the article to include in the flame, what type of symmetry to include, whether to blend the variations using weights or to pick a single variation for each iteration, whether to apply a post transformation and whether to apply a final transformation (optionally including an additional posttransformation). The final image can either be based on a the origin of the attractors or on the log density of the hit count of each pixel (for a more rigid look).

```r
set.seed(2)
canvas_flame(colors = colorPalette("dark2"))

```

#### Flow fields

This artwork implements a version of the algorithm described in the blog post [Flow Fields](https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2020/flow-fields) by Tyler Hobbs. It works by creating a grid of angles and determining how certain points will flow through this field. The angles in the field can be set manually or according to the predictions of a supervised learning method trained on randomly generated data.

```r
set.seed(1)
canvas_flow(colors = colorPalette("dark2"))
# see ?canvas_flow for more input parameters of this function
```

#### Mazes

This artwork creates mazes. The mazes are created using a random walk algorithm (described in the [mazegenerator](https://github.com/matfmc/mazegenerator) repository). The mazes can also be displayed with polar coordinates, creating some pretty cool effects.

<p align="center">

```r
set.seed(1)
canvas_maze(color = "#fafafa")
# see ?canvas_maze for more input parameters of this function
```

#### Meshes

This artwork creates one or more rotating circular morphing meshes on the canvas. The idea behind this artwork is described in [this blogpost](http://rectangleworld.com/blog/archives/462) by Dan Gries with the simple words: *"deformed circles move across the canvas, and trace out these shapes"*. The circle has a three random components at each time step: the center, the radius, and the increase in the radius.

```r
set.seed(1)
canvas_mesh(color = "#000000")
# see ?canvas_mesh for more input parameters of this function
```

#### Petri dishes

This artwork uses a space colonization algorithm (excellently described in [this blogpost](https://medium.com/@jason.webb/space-colonization-algorithm-in-javascript-6f683b743dc5) by Jason Webb) to draw Petri dish colonies. If you add a hole in the middle of the Petri dish, the colony grows around the hole.

canvas_phyllotaxis(colors = colorPalette("tuscany1"))
# see ?canvas_phyllotaxis for more input parameters of this function
```

#### Planets

We all love space, and this type of artwork puts you right between the planets. The algorithm creates one or multiple planets in space and uses a cellular automata (described in the blog post [Neighborhoods: Experimenting with Cyclic Cellular Automata](https://fronkonstin.com/2021/01/02/neighborhoods-experimenting-with-cyclic-cellular-automata/) by Antonio Sánchez Chinchón) to fill in their surfaces. The color and placement of the planets can be set manually.

```r
set.seed(1)
canvas_planet(colors = colorPalette("retro3"))
# see ?canvas_planet for more input parameters of this function
```

#### Recamán's sequence

This function draws Recamán's sequence on a canvas. The algorithm takes increasingly large steps backwards on the positive number line, but takes a step forward if it is unable to perform the step backwards.

<p align="center">
  <img src='https://github.com/koenderks/aRtsy/raw/development/png/recamans/2021-11-02.png' width='30%'>

```r
set.seed(1)
canvas_recaman(colors = colorPalette("random", n = 10))
# see ?canvas_recaman for more input parameters of this function
```

#### Rainbow smoke

This function implements the [rainbow smoke](http://rainbowsmoke.hu/home) algorithm, an original idea from Jozsef Fejes. The algorithm works as follows: First, we select an initial color and apply it to a randomly chosen pixel. Next, we proceed to use the remaining colors one at the time and color pixels in a manner where colors that are alike are positioned near each other.

<p align="center">

```r
set.seed(1)
canvas_smoke(colors = colorPalette("random", 1024))
# see ?canvas_smoke for more input parameters of this function
```

#### Split lines

This function generates a [fractal curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_curve). It starts with four simple lines and proceeds to split each line in four new line segments. If this action is repeated for some time, and each time the same split is made, the end product is a fractal curve. The fractal curve in this function (optionally) uses some noise to create random distortions in the curve.

```r
set.seed(1)
canvas_splits(colors = colorPalette("origami"))
# see ?canvas_splits for more input parameters of this function
```

#### Stripes

This type of artwork is based on the concept of [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion). The algorithm generates a sequence of slightly increasing and decreasing values for each row on the canvas. Next, it fills these according to their generated value. More colors usually make this artwork more interesting.

```r
set.seed(1)
canvas_stripes(colors = colorPalette("random", n = 10))
# see ?canvas_stripes for more input parameters of this function
```

#### Paint strokes

When you think of the act of painting, you probably imagine stroking paint on a canvas. This type of artwork tries to mimic that activity. The algorithm is based on the simple idea that each next point on a grid-based canvas has a chance to take over the color of an adjacent colored point, but also has a minor chance of generating a new color. Going over the canvas like this results in something that looks like strokes of paint.

<p align="center">

```r
set.seed(1)
canvas_strokes(colors = colorPalette("tuscany1"))
# see ?canvas_strokes for more input parameters of this function
```

#### Swirls

In this artwork, inspired by Matt Deslauriers' blog post on [generative art with Node.js and canvas](https://mattdesl.svbtle.com/generative-art-with-nodejs-and-canvas), a particle system takes center stage, giving birth to enchanting swirling lines. The individual particles in the system are subjected to velocities in two directions, dictating the paths they traverse while shaping the swirls on the canvas.

set.seed(1)
canvas_swirls(colors = colorPalette("tuscany1"))
# see ?canvas_swirls for more input parameters of this function
```

#### Portuguese tiles

This function attempts to recreate the intricate designs on Portuguese-style decorative tiles. The artwork uses a reaction-diffusion algorithm, which simulates the process of chemicals reacting and diffusing on a surface (excellently described in these three blogposts: [link](https://itp.uni-frankfurt.de/~gros/StudentProjects/Projects_2020/projekt_schulz_kaefer/), [link](https://www.karlsims.com/rd.html) and [link](https://fronkonstin.com/2019/12/28/reaction-diffusion/)), to generate an initial quarter of each tile. Next, the initial quarter tile is mirrored twice to get the symmetric look that is reminiscent of traditional Portuguese tiles. You can fill the wall with as many unique tiles as you want and specify a custom layout.

#### Turmite

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmite), a turmite is *"a Turing machine which has an orientation in addition to a current state and a "tape" that consists of an infinite two-dimensional grid of cells"*. The classic algorithm consists of repeating the following three simple steps:

1. Turn on the spot (left, right, up, or down),
2. Change the color of the block,
3. Move forward one block.

#### Watercolors

This artwork implements a version of the algorithm described in the blog post [A Guide to Simulating Watercolor Paint with Generative Art](https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2017/a-generative-approach-to-simulating-watercolor-paints) by Tyler Hobbs. It works by layering several geometric shapes and deforming each shape by repeatedly splitting its edges.

### The Geometric collection

The Geometric collection mostly implements algorithms that draw a geometric shape and apply a random color to it.

#### Diamonds

This function creates a set of diamonds on a canvas. The diamonds are filled in (or left out) using a random color assignment.

You can use the `canvas_diamonds()` function to make your own artwork using this algorithm.

```r
set.seed(1)
canvas_diamonds(colors = colorPalette("tuscany1"))
# see ?canvas_diamonds for more input parameters of this function
```

#### Functions

The idea for this type of artwork is taken over from the [`generativeart`](https://github.com/cutterkom/generativeart) package. In this algorithm, the position of every single point is calculated by a formula which has random parameters. You can supply your own formula.

### The Supervised collection

The artworks in the Supervised collection are inspired by decision boundary plots in machine learning tasks. The algorithms in this collection work by generating random data points on a two dimensional surface (with either a continuous or a categorical response variable), which they then try to model using the supervised learning algorithm. Next, they try to predict the color of each pixel on the canvas.

#### Blacklights

This artwork is inspired by a supervised machine learning method called support vector machines. It applies the principle as described above using a continuous response variable to fill the color of the pixels.

```r
set.seed(1)
canvas_blacklight(colors = colorPalette("random", n = 5))
# see ?canvas_blacklight for more input parameters of this function
```

#### Forests

This artwork is inspired by a supervised learning method called random forest. It applies the principle as described above using a continuous response variable to fill the color of the pixels.

```r
set.seed(1)
canvas_forest(colors = colorPalette("jungle"))
# see ?canvas_forest for more input parameters of this function
```

#### Gemstones

This artwork is inspired by a supervised learning method called k-nearest neighbors. It applies the principle as described above using a continuous response variable to fill the color of the pixels. In short, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm computes the distance of each pixel on the canvas to each randomly generated data point and assigns it the color of the value of that data point.

```r
set.seed(1)
canvas_gemstone(colors = colorPalette("dark3"))
# see ?canvas_gemstone for more input parameters of this function
```

#### Mosaics

This artwork also uses a k-nearest neighbors method but instead of a continuous response variable a categorical one is used, making it a classification problem. If you considers fewer neighbors the artwork looks like a mosaic, while higher values make the artwork look more smooth.

set.seed(1)
canvas_mosaic(colors = colorPalette("retro2"))
# see ?canvas_mosaic for more input parameters of this function

#### Nebula

Based on the very same principle as described in the artwork above is this next type of artwork. However, it produces slightly different pictures as it uses different code to create a form of k-nearest neighbors noise. Some of these artworks can resemble nebulas in outer space.

### The Static collection

The Static collection implements static images that produce nice pictures.

#### Circle maps

This type of artwork is based on the concept of an [Arnold tongue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_tongue). According to Wikipedia, Arnold tongues *"are a pictorial phenomenon that occur when visualizing how the rotation number of a dynamical system, or other related invariant property thereof, changes according to two or more of its parameters"*.

#### The Mandelbrot set

This type of artwork visualizes the [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) and other related fractals (e.g., the [Julia set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set), the [Multibrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multibrot_set) and the [Burning ship fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Ship_fractal)). These fractals are well-known examples of a complex structure arising from the application of a simple rule set. You can zoom in on the set and apply some color to create these images below.
